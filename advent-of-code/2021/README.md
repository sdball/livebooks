# Advent of Code 2021

HUGE thanks to José Valim for live streaming his solutions to the 2021 Advent of Code using LiveBook. His streams were a huge inspiration for me to get started with LiveBook. I love it!

Almost all of the solutions here are derivatives of José's solutions.

A wonderful youtuber has been editing José's live streams into YouTube videos. You can start with Day 1 and find the rest.
